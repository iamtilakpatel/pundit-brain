"""Every file we wrote carries a licence notice. Every file we did not is left alone.

A licence at the root of a repository is a claim about the repository. The
thing that actually reaches a stranger is a file -- one .c pasted into a forum
answer, one tool script copied into another tree, one page of documentation
lifted into a wiki. Split from its repository, an unmarked file carries no
author, no terms and no way back to either, and whoever took it is not being
dishonest: they simply have nothing to go on.

So every text file this project wrote states four things itself: the licence
(as an SPDX identifier, which tooling can read), the copyright holder, where
the work came from, and what reuse requires. That is the whole of it. It grants
nothing new and takes nothing back.

Run it as a check:

    python tools/check_licenses.py

and as its own fix, which is the point of writing it as a tool rather than as a
rule in a CONTRIBUTING file -- a rule that has to be remembered 200 times is a
rule that will be missed:

    python tools/check_licenses.py --fix

WHAT IS EXEMPT, AND WHY. Four kinds of file, each for a reason rather than for
convenience:

  - VENDORED THIRD-PARTY SOURCE (VENDORED below). The conformer engine and its
    tensor library (Apache-2.0, lspr98), the SVOX Pico sources and DiUS's
    resource loader (Apache-2.0), and the cardputer-ai engine files (MIT,
    REZOR). These are not ours to re-header. Stamping our notice on somebody
    else's Apache or MIT file is the same error as stripping theirs, pointed
    the other way -- and it is the header a downstream reader would rely on.
    They keep the notices their authors put on them; THIRD_PARTY.md records
    what they are.

    The two engine files we DID substantially rewrite -- neo.c/neo.h and the
    PIE kernel -- are in DERIVED instead, and carry both: the upstream
    attribution they arrived with, and our notice for the port, because the
    port is a modification we are answerable for.

  - LICENCE TEXTS. LICENSE is the FSF's and may not be modified; the upstream
    licence files and everything under THIRD_PARTY/ are other people's texts.

  - FILES WITH NO COMMENT SYNTAX: binaries, archives, and the data files under
    host/. A notice cannot be put in a file with nowhere to put it.

  - Third-party MODEL documentation under components/story_stt, which describes
    someone else's weights under their terms.

WHAT GENERATED FILES DO. A generated source file carries the same header as a
handwritten one, emitted by its generator, so that regenerating it cannot
quietly strip the notice. Generators call header_for()/markdown_footer() rather
than carrying their own copy of the wording: two copies of a licence header is
one copy that will fall behind.
